<h1 style="color: aliceblue;"> <b>The Road Not Taken</b>
</h1>
<p style="color: aliceblue; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
	And sorry I could not travel both <br>
	And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
	And looked down one as far as I could<br>
	To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>
</p>

<p style="color: aliceblue; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
  Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
	And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br> 
	Though as for that the passing there<br>
	Had worn them really about the same,<br> 
</p>

<p style="color: aliceblue; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
	And both that morning equally lay<br>   
	In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
	I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
</p>
<p style="color: aliceblue; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
	I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
	I took the one less traveled by,<br>
	And that has made all the difference.<br>
</p>
