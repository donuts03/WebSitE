<h1 style="color: whitesmoke;"> <b>Stopping By The Woods On a Snowy Evening</b>
</h1>
<p style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
	Whose woods these are I think I know. <br>
	His house is in the village though;<br>
	He will not see me stopping here<br>
	To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br> 
</p>

<p style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
   My little horse must think it queer<br>
	To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
	Between the woods and frozen lake<br> 
	The darkest evening of the year.
	<br>
</p>

<p style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
	But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,<br>   
	He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
	To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
	The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br>
	Of easy wind and downy flake.
	<br>
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
	The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
	But I have promises to keep,<br>And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
	And miles to go before I sleep.<br>
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
