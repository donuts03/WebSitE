<p style="color: aliceblue; font-family: Garamond, serif; font-size: 20px ;">
  When my love swears that she is made of truth<br>
  I do believe her, though I know she lies,<br>
  That she might think me some untutor’d youth,<br>
  Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.<br>
 Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>   
  Although she knows my days are past the best,<br>
 Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:<br>
 On both sides thus is simple truth suppress’d.<br>
 But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<br>
 And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>
 O, love’s best habit is in seeming trust,<br>
 And age in love loves not to have years told:<br>
 Therefore I lie with her and she with me,<br>
 And in our faults by lies we flatter’d be.<br>
